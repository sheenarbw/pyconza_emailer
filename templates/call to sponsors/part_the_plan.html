<h2>The plan</h2>

<p>
  Given the current global climate, and the support of our past attendees, we have
  chosen to take PyConZA 2021 online. This means that both sponsorship package
  and ticket prices will be substantially lower due to lower overheads.
</p>

<p>
  This is what our online conference will look like:
</p>

<li> 2 days of talks </li>
<li> Live-streamed presentations, lightning talks and question/answer sessions </li>
<li> Chat rooms for attendees to: catch up with fellow attendees, break away into specialized discussion groups (which was very  successful in 2020), and receive live announcements </li>
<li> Live sponsor-interactive events like raffles and competitions </li>

<p>We understand that online conferences are not easy to get right. We are working hard to make this as awesome as possible by increasing audience participation and interaction. </p>
