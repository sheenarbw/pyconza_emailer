<p>
    The PyConZA team would like to thank you for your previous support! As a growing, community-run conference sponsorship is a necessity. ${company}'s previous sponsorship was an important part of our success.
</p>

<p>
    This year PyConZA will be held on the 7th and 8th of October. We hope that you will consider sponsoring us again. And we hope you will consider joining us at the event.
</p>

<h2>Why sponsor?</h2>

<p>
    PyConZA is an excellent opportunity to connect and engage with some of the best
    minds in Africa and abroad. Expected attendance numbers are difficult to gauge
    at the moment, but given past years successes, we're very positive about
    attendance numbers this year. Especially as people will not have to travel
    from around the country and abroad. So we hope you will:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Join a high-tech event with high visibility</li>
    <li>Learn and share success cases</li>
    <li>Connect your brand to open and collaborative free software initiatives etc etc blah blah</li>
    <li>Train your team</li>
    <li>Hire cutting-edge scientists, developers and tech-minded people</li>
    <li>Offer your services and products</li>
    <li>Get recognition for your brand in South Africa and abroad</li>
</ul>
