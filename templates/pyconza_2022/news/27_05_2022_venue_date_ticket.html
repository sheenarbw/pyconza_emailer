<h2>Ticket sales are open</h2>
<p>
We have a variety of tickets to choose from. Get yours while they are still at early-bird prices :)
</p>
<p>
It's important to note that if you pick up an online conference ticket then that will not give you access to the physical event.
</p>
<p>
    The in-person event is an expensive thing to put together and we do pay the venue per head, so if you buy an online-only ticket and you show up at the venue we will unfortunately have to turn you away.
</p>
<p>

    If you want to join us in person, but don't have the funds for the ticket, then you can apply for financial aid. The details are on the tickets page:

<h2>Call for speakers</h2>

<p>We'll be opening talk submissions next week.</p>
<p>As a community-focused event, we accept, support and greatly appreciate anyone who steps up.</p>
<p>If you are new to public speaking it's worth knowing that PyConZA usually draws a very friendly and supportive crowd. We also have volunteers who are willing to support you as you refine your talk idea, and who can coach you in public speaking. </p>
