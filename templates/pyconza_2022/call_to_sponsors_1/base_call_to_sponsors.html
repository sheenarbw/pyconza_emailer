    <h2>Why sponsor?</h2>

    <p>
        PyConZA is an excellent opportunity to connect and engage with some of the best
        minds in Africa and abroad. Expected attendance numbers are difficult to gauge
        at the moment, but given past years successes, we're very positive about
        attendance numbers this year.
    </p>
    <p>
        This year we are running a hybrid conference - in person conferences tend to be more engaging in many ways. But given the successes of our remote conferences in recent years, we are aiming to support both remote and in-person participation. This will increase our participation footprint - and the visibility of your fine brand :)
    </p>
    <p>
        The in-person part of PyConZA 2022 will be hosted in Durban, South Africa,  and the remote portion will be hosted everywhere.  The final dates and location will be announced around the beginning of July.
